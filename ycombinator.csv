Meanwhile, there's a proven treatment that increases survival rates by 600%, and it's low cost, discreet, and convenient. It's called MAT, and it looks like treatment for anxiety or depression: medication plus therapy. However, doctors need a special waiver to prescribe the medication, which fewer than 5% of them have, so it's difficult to get, and most people are buying it on the street. Sadly, drug dealers aren't doctors: every 11 minutes another American dies of an opioid overdose, now the #1 cause of death for Americans under 50.

Ophelia is replacing rehab with telemedicine, using proven science and a consumer-first approach. The opioid treatment market in the U.S. is $15B, and 85% of opioid addicts have insurance that pays for it. We're treating roughly 400 patients with thousands more waiting.

Their mission is to have a positive impact on the environment, local communities, and the housing crisis through their sustainable approach.

Mighty Buildings' technology has the potential to unlock the needed productivity for large scale construction alongside the opportunity for reduced emissions, leading to a more sustainable product and future. Mighty Buildings was founded by a team of physicists and robotics engineers with extensive experience solving hard R&D problems and building successful engineering firms. They started by inventing a new material that is a 3D printing tech that enabled printing of an entire building, not just walls, in a single cycle. Unlike concrete, Mighty Buildings’ material is lighter, can be uniquely treated (trimmed and cut) by robotic arms, and features high thermal insulation properties. This allows them to produce prefab housing with up to 80% of operations automated.

Mighty Buildings has a near-zero waste production process, preventing 1,100 - 2,000 kg of CO2 emission per 3D-printed home. They are committed to achieving Net-Zero by 2028 - making the company 22 years ahead of the construction industry.

The company is certified under California's Factory Built Housing program to build units using 3D-printing, but they are also the first company to achieve certification under the UL 3401 standard for evaluating building structures and assemblies."

For context, we've closed 4 venture rounds in 2.5 years, in addition to our celebrity round of funding. 

**What we're doing**

We are building a complete digital health hub for future fathers/parents. We aim to change the outdated view that fertility is a ""women's issue"" by creating an accessible, affordable product for men & people with sperm. This includes everything from a mail-in kit for sperm testing & sperm freezing, personalized sperm improvement products, tele-health, DNA fragmentation analysis, supplements, and more.

**Why are we the leader?** 

The company was founded at Harvard by a team of healthcare and fertility experts. We obsess about talent density and have out-executed our competitors over the past few years. Beyond our D2C channel, we've also unlocked:

1. Insurance (We cover over 10M individuals through insurance in NY and CA)
2. Military (We serve the Navy SEALs & other SpecOps through exclusive programs)
3. Employers (We work with the top fertility benefit providers like Progyny, Carrot, and Maven)

We’re a small (but growing) team building an open source platform that empowers customers to create successful products.

Until now, tools for building products have been fragmented. Product analytics, heat maps, session recording and A/B testing all provide immense value, but existing tools weren’t natively built to work together.

PostHog is different by offering these tools (and more) in a single platform that you can host yourself.

We started PostHog as part of Y Combinator's W20 cohort and had the most successful B2B software launch on HackerNews since 2012 - with a product that was just 4 weeks old.

We're proudly backed by some of the world's top investors and believe in product-led growth, where we build something awesome and let our product bring the users, rather than an outbound sales team and regular cold calls.

What does this mean for you? We have a lot of capital, but we're a lean, strong team - so you've got the opportunity to have a huge impact.

Whether building a single-use device from scratch or scaling a line of smart products, with Mason it’s 20x faster and 10x less costly to build, deploy and scale.

Our customers are organizations like transit agencies and employers who have existing vanpool fleets. We provide these customers with our SaaS platform that manages their vanpool programs.

This process is broken. We install cameras and remote monitoring software on the assembly line, and this ensures compliance with test protocol, improves quality, reduces liability, and helps fight warranty fraud.

We charge a nominal per-unit fee to the OEM and revenue share with the factory when they demonstrate compliance with quality standards (whether units pass or fail).

It encourages better behavior from factories and rewards those who perform with an audit trail of good performance that helps them win new foreign business.

Travellers get the best price and they help local businesses avoid unnecessary fees. 

Travel experts, content creators and the friends you always ask for recommendations can use The Guide to showcase their favourite places to stay and things to do. When you book one of their recommendations, you’ll get a discount from the business and they receive bonus credit to say thanks.

The Tab platform gives independent tourism businesses the tools to improve their online presence, be discovered, take direct bookings — and also to take payments. Our payment platform is uniquely designed for tourism businesses, handling over 100 currencies natively, and every payment type securely and easily.

As travel returns after a difficult period, it’s time for a fresh approach. That’s why we’re building a social commerce platform for tourism — helping to spread the benefits of tourism far and wide, and helping travellers make the most of their precious time abroad.

Today, Resolve helps bridge the communication gap between people who operate buildings and those who design and build them. We've built the most robust application for reviewing industrial facilities on wireless VR devices like the Oculus Quest - our customers love it because it just works even with complex 3D building models.

From data centers to cutting-edge biopharma facilities, Resolve provides a collaborative virtual environment for operations & maintenance teams to review and interact with 3D building models at full scale - decreasing late stage changes during the construction process and delivering a safer, more easily operable building.

Our customers' facilities contain a multitude of complex systems which require careful coordination and review to ensure the building is completed on time and within budget. To prevent rework and increased building maintenance costs, Resolve fixes the broken system of screen-sharing 3D models and 2D floorplans with the operations teams that inherit the building and, instead, gives them easy access to their 3D building models before concrete is poured."

Each backpacker, regardless of their role as a carrier or a shopper, follows a simple four-step process to either earn or save money from their backpacking experience.
Travelers share their travel information and specify what kind of items they want to carry. Then they wait to get a ""backpack request"" and ask their price. Finally, they confirm the deal, buy the items, deliver them and earn money. Shoppers on the other hand, search items from their favorite websites and fill out the item description. Then they give their location and find a traveler coming to their city. Finally they ""request backpack"" and confirm the deal. Within days they can get the product and save money.  

backpack is founded with a vision to provide every citizen of the world with a choice; the choice of buying organic, authentic, and cost effective products with minimum friction.

Lawdingo gives people seeking legal services direct access to independent lawyers who can help them. Such attorneys usually have more flexible hours, lower rates, and greater interest in customer service than to their larger firm counterparts. The problem is that there is so many such lawyers; how is someone supposed to figure out who is right for them, and who has some time to take on their case? Fair question. Coincidentally, we started Lawdingo to answer just that. 

If you're looking for a lawyer, we encourage you to try finding an easier way to get one to work for you. If you are a lawyer working in solo or small practice, we encourage you to find a more effective way to grow your law practice. 

We also encourage you not to take our word for it. Read what Solo Practice University, the ABA Journal, FindLaw, AboveTheLaw, TechCrunch, Lifehacker, and others say about us. This isn't some fly-by-the-night company. This is the future of the legal industry. We hope you'll get in touch. 

Lawdingo was started by Nikhil Nirmel (nikhil@lawdingo.com), an entrepreneur with a background at Yelp and Wharton Undergrad, and Dan Langevin , a ridiculously talented technologist who was formerly CTO of Lifebooker. Lawdingo has backing from Y Combinator and other investors."

We make it easier for enterprise machine learning teams to design continuous pipelines that ingest, organize, and process imaging data. 

For example, you could use Eventual to build visual analytics by processing video feeds in the cloud from data uploaded from a manufacturing assembly line.

Although there’s plenty of data warehouses for unstructured text/tabular data, there’s not a turn-key one for imaging and videos. Currently users jerry-rig one together with multiple vendors or hard to manage open-source frameworks. We are a one-stop shop. 

1.  Query Interface: SQL works great for tabular analytics, but is a poor fit for running queries and transformations on imaging data. On Eventual, the interface is a Lambda function that can be written in your language of choice or even bash! These functions can then be run locally or on the cloud in both a standalone or pipeline fashion.

2. Shared Data Architecture: Data is stored in your own cloud storage using open formats such as Parquet. Eventual provides out-of-the-box integrations with your current storage providers such as AWS S3, PostgreSQL and more.

3. Intelligent Scheduling: Our scheduling engine takes into account resource availability, data transfer costs and predictive metrics to optimize your workloads, saving you time and money. This is especially the case with costly instances and hardware accelerators like GPUs.

•  Received 157 pre-orders for Olympian Model O1  ($15M+ pre-booked revenue)
•  Radically minimalistic cockpit and 'data-privacy-first' architecture powered by Olympian Operating System (OOS)
•  Rapid go-to-market: We have secured key partnerships to deliver the first Olympian O1 EVs  to customers by November 2022. (It took 9+ years for Lucid and 11+ years for Rivian to make their first commercial shipment).
•  Olympian has a unique fully 'fabless' production model in the U.S., running an asset-light operation with no CAPEX or no front R&D - unlike other conventional EV companies in the U.S.
•  We disrupt today’s commoditized car experience, elevate low quality/comfort standards, simplify over-complicated cockpit/UX, and create a new ‘experience-first’ consumer segment in the automotive.


We prioritize:
- Aesthetics over horsepower
- User experience over torque
- Classiness over top-speed
- Data privacy or data exchange
- Edge computing over cloud computing
- Minimalism over 30+ buttons and switches in the cockpit
- AR HUD over 2D Display screens
- Wood, steel and titanium materials over cheap plastic and veneer
- Sustainable & natural materials over toxic chemicals


We are creating the next big story in automotive.

Skin surface pH is constantly in flux, and many of your daily activities can throw it out of balance. People with chronic skin conditions such as eczema have a harder time regulating their skin's pH. 

Soteri's patented pH/LOCK™ locks skin in at a therapeutic pH for 12+ hours, which is shown to help break the cycle of skin sensitivity, whether you have eczema, psoriasis, or just a bad sunburn.

Our formulations are aesthetically elegant (non-sticky, sit well under makeup, etc), safe for anyone to use, and don't require a prescription. Most people see skin health improvements within the first few weeks of application, even for tricky, chronic skin conditions like eczema and psoriasis.

With Soteri Skin, anyone can enjoy healthy, glowing, pH-enomenal skin!"

On average, store owners buy products from over 10-15 different suppliers each week. This painful process involves shopping in massive warehouses or spending hours working with wholesaler’s sales representatives (who sometimes don’t even show up). As a result, stores waste countless hours ordering products through extremely inefficient and tedious processes. These store owners are also severely impacted by inventory shortages and revenue loss which many times results in them downsizing their business or shutting them down completely.

Attain solves this problem by providing a single app to purchase products across all of their suppliers, resulting in a one-stop shop for inventory. By aggregating inventory across a multitude of suppliers and wholesalers, Attain helps stores save significant time and money while allowing them to focus on what they do best - growing their businesses.

Globally, the electric vehicle market is exploding. Particularly in India, where more than 40% of the new automobile sales are expected to be electric by 2030!

The thing that fascinates us is that virtually 100% of them are connected to the cloud, which captures and stores telematics, battery, and other mobility data. Unfortunately, there is no easy way for companies to interact with them as there is no user-friendly API or developer portal provided by any brand. For all of these vehicles, we create a single, standardized API.

Here are some immediate use cases we are powering:
1. Smart route planning, to reduce range anxiety and save money by optimizing battery usage for EV owners. 
2. Insurance companies use our telematics data to reward good drivers and also to assess battery degradation. 
3. Finally, fleets are electrifying, necessitating centralized and remote monitoring. Our API enables this transition by providing a unified interface for all vehicles irrespective of brand.

To sum up, the world is going electric and our API is going to power them all! 🚀

By referencing data schemas, JumpWire labels select properties inside data payloads and transforms the raw data into a protected format, using encryption, tokenization or masking. JumpWire’s approach to securing data in-place minimizes the risk of data leaks exposing sensitive information or mishandling by other applications and vendors. The exact security scheme applied to data is defined by policies that align with an organization’s existing InfoSec program.

JumpWire helps companies who maintain information security with compliance programs such as SOC or HIPAA. They are processing sensitive data, often from their own customers, and exceed security best practices as a competitive advantage. JumpWire provides defense at depth to data and sits alongside access controls and Layer 4 encryption to provide a comprehensive data security solution.

JumpWire is unique from solutions such as data vaults by installing inside our customers’ own infrastructure and clouds. It is interoperable with existing applications and databases, which eliminates the need for large data migrations or code refactoring. Lower-level approaches to data security, such as encryption at rest, are too blunt and lack the ability to differentiate between properties in the data itself. Its scope is limited to physical storage, and security is lost as soon as an application or query loads the data."

60% of the $1.4T global woodworking market is serviced by small businesses with inefficient, manual processes - Cutr is digitising their workflow. This market is massive, chaotic and surprisingly manual. Woodworkers are mostly offline, hard to find and even harder to vet. They need help with critical back-of-house jobs like quoting and capacity planning. Customers have no idea where to find them and need help asking the right questions & providing the right info to get their job produced correctly. 

Cutr solves discovery, pricing, payments and workflow for the woodworking market. 

Our users simply upload a file, accept an instant quote, and get their parts delivered. To make that possible we do the heavy lifting: filechecks, automated quoting, matchmaking, creating job packages, tracking changes & updates, logistics and payments.

😫 The problem 

For 30 million online tutors worldwide, the #1 pain point is: Students’ Zoom boredom.
Because a bored student is a customer who won’t stay long.

😎 The solution

We built a gamified platform for online tutors to teach kids online.

80,000 classes later, it’s clear that kids love this metaverse and beg their parents for more classes. This translates into higher retention and more business for tutors who use Koala instead of Zoom.

💰 Monetization

With a premium subscription, tutors unlock additional tools to grow their business.
And when parents pay tutors through our platform, we take 5%.

📈 Market

In 2021, parents paid $166B to online tutors.

A startup in exactly our space, Outschool, is worth $3B, 5 years after YC.


In 10 years, every live online class will happen in Koala.

We're raising a $2M seed with $1M already allocated. If you’re an awesome investor, please contact Xavier at xavier@teachwithkoala.com.

Brandon and Mina both have engineering degrees, and are building Flightcontrol to solve those same problems we personally experienced as consultants.

We discovered AWS is built for low-level developers who want maximum performance and control, and Heroku was built as an easy solution for developers who didn’t need that control. 15 years later, there’s now a large segment of developers who do want maximum performance and control but without the difficulty of AWS.

Flightcontrol solves this by providing a layer on top of AWS that makes it very easy to use and let’s them pop the hood leverage the raw power of AWS. Because of this new approach, users have migrated their production apps to Flightcontrol from Heroku, Render, Vercel, and existing AWS setups they previously spent weeks building.

Problem:
East Africa is home to 500 million people, with a median age of 18, growing at ~3% annually. Favourable demographics and population growth, compounded with GDP growth of ~6 - 8% underpin a fast-growing middle class.

Nonetheless, East African currencies depreciate 15 - 20% per annum on average - this is the biggest impediment to wealth protection and creation for this middle class.

Solution:
We offer the middle class access to high-APY savings in stable currencies and financial services that enable consumers to spend as they go in local currencies. We do this using both banking infrastructure and Web3.

Motivation:
Being from countries with volatile currencies, we have seen family and friends lose large portions of their savings to inflation - this is what fuels our passion about this problem and what motivates us to build Bloom."

Professional recruiters can now monetize the excess candidate inventory created from their primary business. This is work they've already done but previously couldn't benefit from. Likewise, candidates won't have to start the vetting process over from scratch again and again since they'll be able to be referred with context and get warm intros into hot hiring companies that can be hard to access.

After we graduated (from MIT & other US colleges), we started our first education company in 2007, focusing on coaching school students in STEM subjects.

We worked closely with students (many of them from underprivileged backgrounds) and saw firsthand the impact we’ve had on them. 

We then realized that with technology, we could reach more students and bring more impact. Hence, we released Pandai in 2020. 

🚀 Present & Future

Currently, we have launched in our home ground Malaysia in 2020. 

So far, 280,000 students have completed 83 million questions on Pandai, and 92% of users have seen some improvement in their academic performance. 

We plan to expand to Southeast Asia and other emerging markets, a market of 100M+ school students. Pandai is designed to be scalable, and our content (also available in English) can be mapped to other curricula from other countries. "
